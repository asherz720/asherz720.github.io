    abstract = {This paper investigates the clausal embedding pattern of the Mandarin verb {``}xiang{''} (think) and reveals its internal anti-interrogative nature, with the possibility of {``}xiang Q{''} in certain cases. Through various stativity tests, I establish that the results are consistent with the generalization proposed by {\"O}zy{\i}ld{\i}z(2021), with {``}minor{''} deviations observed in the stativity of {``}xiang P{''} and the correlation with neg-raising. Additionally, I employ a semantic shift perspective to explain instances of neg-raising failure. Overall, this study sheds light on the unique characteristics of the verb {``}xiang{''} and contributes to a better cross-linguistic understanding of CP selection.},
