## About Me

<p align="justify"> Hi there! I'm Asher ['æʃə] and my Chinese name is Zheng Anshun (郑安顺) [ʈʂə̂ŋ ɑ̄n ʂwə̂n]. I'm a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://jessyli.com/" target="_blank">Jessy Li</a> and Prof. <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/linguistics/faculty/dib97" target="_blank">David Beaver</a>. I'm in the syntax/semantics group and computational linguistics group at UT. Before that I did a master's in Speech and Language Processing (or Computational Linguistics) with <em>distinction</em> at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, advised by Dr. <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/" target="_blank">Catherine Lai</a>. Previous to that, I received a B.A. in English Language and Literature from <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng">Hanyang University</a>, <em>summa cum laude</em>. My research revolves around the meaning of language (semantics) and how meaning is construed in different contexts (pragmatics). The issues I am interested in and working with are clausal complementation, bias, evidentiality, QUDs, and many other aspects of QUESTIONS.</p>
<!-- 
 My efforts, at present, are directed to provide cross-linguistic evidence from Eastern Asian Languages (e.g., Mandarin and Korean) for the existing theories, in order to form a universal picture of CP selection. In addition, the syntactic realization of semantic selection is also of my interest, which I believe will lead to a beautiful theory posited at the syntax-semantics interface.  -->

<!-- <p align="justify">At Edinburgh, I worked with Dr. <a href="https://kdjarv.wixsite.com/kajsadjarv">Kajsa Djärv</a>, who directed me to explore the amazing field of clausal complement selection to figure out the reasons behind the CP selection patterns across predicates (e.g., <em>know</em>, <em>wonder</em> and <em>believe</em>). On a more computational note, I use the cutting-edge models such as BERT, GPT etc. to computationalize linguistic theories. My M.Sc. thesis advised by Dr. <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/" target="_blank">Catherine Lai</a> was to construct an expectation-driven QUD model/pipeline. I also hold a minor interest in grammar competition and language variation because of Professor <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/caroline-heycock">Caroline Heycock</a>. I have not really done any work on this field, but I have learned about a number of theories connected to computation and acquisition (e.g., Constant Rate, Tolerance Principle), which I would very much want to dive into in the future.</p> -->
<!-- , on which I test e.g., syntax-discourse interface (e.g., Ellipsis) and Semantics-discourse interface (e.g., exclusives).  -->


<p align="justify">Outside of academia, I have been watching K-dramas for more than a decade. They are cliches sometimes but very relaxing every time. I'm not a big fan of sports but I do work out regularly. In addition, I like learning languages and practicing calligraphy but procrastination comes flooding sometimes.</p>
