## About Me

Hi there! I'm Asher ['æʃə] and my Chinese name is Zheng Anshun (郑安顺) [ʈʂə̂ŋ ɑ̄n ʂwə̂n]. I just finished my Masters' in Speech and Language Processing (or Computational Linguistics) at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/" target="_blank">Catherine Lai</a>, and is now seeking for a PhD position. Previous to that, I have received a B.A. in English Language and Literature from <a href="https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng">Hanyang University</a>, *summa cum laude*. My research revolves around the structure and the meaning of language (syntax and semantics), discourse and their interafces. Computational Modeling of Language (discourse and syntax in particular) is another direction I am also pursuing. 
<!-- 
 My efforts, at present, are directed to provide cross-linguistic evidence from Eastern Asian Languages (e.g., Mandarin and Korean) for the existing theories, in order to form a universal picture of CP selection. In addition, the syntactic realization of semantic selection is also of my interest, which I believe will lead to a beautiful theory posited at the syntax-semantics interface.  -->

At Edinburgh, I worked with Professor <a href="https://kdjarv.wixsite.com/kajsadjarv">Kajsa Djärv</a>, who directed me to explore the amazing field of Clausal Complement selection to figure out the reasons behind the CP selectional patterns across predicates (e.g., know, wonder and believe). On a more computational note, I use the cutting-edge models such as BERT, GPT etc. to computationalize linguistic theories. My M.Sc. thesis advised by Professor <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/" target="_blank">Catherine Lai</a> is to construct a expectation-driven QUD model/pipeline. I also hold a minor interest in grammar competition and language variation because of Professor <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/caroline-heycock">Caroline Heycock</a>. I have not really done any works on this field, but I have learned about a number of theories connected to computation and acquisition (e.g., Constant Rate, Tolerance Principle), which I would very much want to dive into in the future.
<!-- , on which I test e.g., syntax-discourse interface (e.g., Ellipsis) and Semantics-discourse interface (e.g., exclusives).  -->



Outside of academia, I have been watching K-dramas for more than a decade. They are cliched sometimes but very relaxing every time. I'm also a fan of learning languages and caligraphy but procrastination comes flooding sometimes.


## Research Interests
- **Syntax:** Complementizer Phrases (CP), Cartography, Ellipsis, Locality 
- **Semantics & Pragmatics:** Clausal Complement Selection, Question Under Discussion (QUD), Information Structure 
- **Computational Linguistics:** Computational Discourse (esp.QUDs)
