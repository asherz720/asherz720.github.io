										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>Hello! and welcome to my world of language exploration! My name is Zheng Anshun(郑安顺) [ʈʂəˋŋaˉnʂwəˋn] but also I go by Asher['æʃə] for non-mandarin friends. I've been a language enthusiast for most of my life, and I'm sure you are too, albeit with varying degrees of proficiency. As a linguist, my current research interests revolve around the intersection of linguistics and computer science. Specifically, I'm currently delving into the exciting fields of NLP, speech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition. In the past, I've been passionate about syntactic theories and have always been curious about how probabilistic syntax parsing benefits the development of syntax, as well as how to assign semantic information to parses. On a more linguistic note, I'm also deeply intrigued by binding, finiteness, CP selection and islands in Mandarin and Korean.

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>I have done several interesting projects on language technology (NLP, ASR, TTS). Although some of these projects may seem simple, they have all provided valuable insights into how technology can be used to deal with language problems.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<h4>ASR & TTS</h4>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/festival.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/asr.png" alt="" /></a>
												<h4>Evaluate TTS system Festival</h4>
												<p>Based on what TTS systems at different stages (both front end and back end), I inspected the performance of Festival tts system and found different types of errors such as mis-taggings, rule-missing, abrupt concatenation etc. Furthermore, I wrote a paper which describes the execution and assessment of the Festival Multisyn unit selection speech synthesis. Through three experiments, the study identifies various factors that may affect the quality of the unit selection voice, as well as how the system handles the synthesis of interrogatives without prosodic modelling.</p>
											
										</article>
										<article>
											
											
												<h4>Automatic digit recogniser</h4>
												<p>This project aimed to create a speaker-independent digit recogniser(1-10) and evaluate its performance under different conditions. This system takes MFCC as features and implements a HMM to model audio information with each one containing a GMM. By controlling different factors like speakers' sex, recording devices, and accents, I had several findings including factors influencing ASR accuracy and the potential NLP biases existing in ASR system.  </p>
											
										</article>
										<article>
									
											
												<h4>Diphone based synthesizer</h4>
												<p>I designed a diphone synthesizer based on an existing diphone database. It is able to 'speak' in a non-prosodic way</p>
											
										</article>
										
										<article>
											<h4>NLP, NLU & MT</h4>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/n-gram.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>N-gram model</h4>
												<p>In this project, I created a tri-character model based on a corpus. It is able to generate the third character based on the previous two characters.  </p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/dialogue.png" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>MaxEnt Model implemented for BIO tagging</h4>
												<p>BIO tagging is shown to be useful in information extraction (query) of dialogue system. To deal with that, I employed multinomial logistic regression model with different input features (i.e., word embeddings, dependency). I also investigated what kind of features did well in this classification task.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
									
											
											<h4>Comparing performance of RNNs and GRU </h4>
											<p>This project tends to figure out the factors that influence current neural models. By controlling different factors such as backpropogation steps, learning rate, I saw different effects on the results as well as the advantages and disadvantges of using different neural models.</p>
										
									</article>
									<article>
									
											
										<h4>Transformer-based German-English translation</h4>
										<p>I intended to implement the algorithms in "attention is all you need" (multi-head attention) and the transformer architecture to create a machine translation system. This project also did a comparative work on the performance between lstms and transformers. The results show with more complex architecture like transformer, it does not necessarily lead to good results.</p>

									 	<h2>My Research</h2>
										<p>
										<span class="align-left">My area of research begins with studying syntactic theories. I am particularly interested in exploring the intricate concepts of binding, movement, and islands, which have important connections to semantics. Caroline and her group on language variation and competition have influenced my thinking, leading me to investigate various theories such as the Tolerance Principle, constant rate hypothesis, and innovation diffusion to model variation. In addition to these areas, I am also intrigued by the topic of finiteness in Mandarin, which I am exploring as part of my efforts to understand semantic CP selection. Because in Mandarin different meanings of one word may lead to different syntactic constraints on CPs.   </span>
